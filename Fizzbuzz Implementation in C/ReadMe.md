  <dd> 
    <ul> 
      <li> It is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n, where, for a given input number (n), for each integer i in the range from 1 to n </li>
      <ul>     
        <li> If i is a multiple of both 3 and 5 prints "FizzBuzz" instead of number </li>
        <li> If i is a multiple of 3 but not 5 prints "Fizz" instead of number. </li>
        <li>If i is a multiple of 5 but not 3 prints "Buzz" instead of number. </li>
        <li> If i is a not multiple of 3 or 5 prints the value of i. </li>

 <h2> About the Program </h2>
 <ul>
  <li> The program is implemented using C language using a for-loop and if-else statements. </li>
  <li> The for-loop runs from 1 until it reaches the value of n, incrementing every iteration. </li>
  <li> Inside the for-loop if-else statements determining if the value of i is divisible by 3, 5, or 15 using modulo. </li>
  <li> It prints the value of i if the modulo returns 1 and FIZZBUZZ, FIZZ, or BUZZ in place of numbers that are divisible by 15, 3, or 5 respectively. </li>
  <li> The program terminates when the value of i is equal to n. </li>
 </ul>
